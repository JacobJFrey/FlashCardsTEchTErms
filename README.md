# Flash Cards TEch TErms
A simple flash card programme to assist in learning coding terms we have learned at Tech Elevator Bootcamp.

I want to code a simple flash card program where the user can get a stack of flash cards, iterate through them, and learn Acronyms and Terms.

## TO-DO ##
1. JS Data Base with Tech Terms
  1A: Expand to other Flash Card collections: Java, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
  1B: Acronyms could utilize triple sided Flash Cards: Acronym, Full Name, Definition
2. Add shuffle to randomize the list of Flash Cards
3. Quiz Portion
  3A. Show Term: Hide Definition: User Prompts Reveal
  3B. Show Term: Show Definition: User Prompts Hide / Next Term
  3C. After Stack completed: User Prompt to Shuffle New Stack
